### Introduction to Computer Program

Before gettting into computer programming, let us first understand computer programs and what they do.

​			A computer program is a sequence of instructions written using a Computer Programming

​			Language to perform a specified task by the computer.

The two important terms that we have used in the above definition are -

- Sequence of instructions
- Computer Programming Language

To understand these terms, consider a situation when someone asks you about how to go to a nearby KFC. What exactly do you do to tell him the way to go to KFC?

You will use Human Language to tell the way to go to KFC, something as follows -

> First go straight, after half kilometer, take left from the red light and then drive around 
>
> one kilometer and you will find KFC at the right.

Here, you have used English Language to give several steps to be taken to reach KFC. If they are followed in the 

following sequence, then you will reach KFC -

```
1. Go straight
2. Drive half kilometer
3. Take left 
4. Drive around one kilometer
5. Search for KFC at your right side
```

Now, try to map the situation with a computer program. The above sequence of instrcutions is actually a Human Program written in English Language, which instructs on how to reach KFC from a given starting point, This same sequence could have been given in Spanish, Arabic, or any other human language, provided the person seeking direction knows any of these language.

## Algorithm(**al**·gr·i·thm)

From programming point of view,an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure(pruh·**see**·jr) to resolve any problem. An  algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite set of well-defined instructions.
